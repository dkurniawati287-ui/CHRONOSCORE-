        Attributes

        Examples
        --------
        In the example below the default parameters give the next 52-53 week fiscal year.
    
        >>> ts = pd.Timestamp(2022, 1, 1)
        >>> ts + pd.offsets.FY5253()
        Timestamp('2022-01-31 00:00:00')
    
        By the parameter ``startingMonth`` we can specify
        the month in which fiscal years end.
    
        >>> ts = pd.Timestamp(2022, 1, 1)
        >>> ts + pd.offsets.FY5253(startingMonth=3)
        Timestamp('2022-03-28 00:00:00')
    
        52-53 week fiscal year can be specified by
        ``weekday`` and ``variation`` parameters.
    
        >>> ts = pd.Timestamp(2022, 1, 1)
        >>> ts + pd.offsets.FY5253(weekday=5, startingMonth=12, variation="last")
        Timestamp('2022-12-31 00:00:00')
