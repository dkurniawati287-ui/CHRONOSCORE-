from .RelativeDeltaOffset import RelativeDeltaOffset

class DateOffset(RelativeDeltaOffset):
    """
    Standard kind of date increment used for a date range.
    
        Works exactly like the keyword argument form of relativedelta.
        Note that the positional argument form of relativedelta is not
        supported. Use of the keyword n is discouraged-- you would be better
        off specifying n in the keywords you use, but regardless it is
        there for you. n is needed for DateOffset subclasses.
    
        DateOffset works as follows.  Each offset specify a set of dates
        that conform to the DateOffset.  For example, Bday defines this
        set to be the set of dates that are weekdays (M-F).  To test if a
        date is in the set of a DateOffset dateOffset we can use the
        is_on_offset method: dateOffset.is_on_offset(date).
    
        If a date is not on a valid date, the rollback and rollforward
        methods can be used to roll the date to the nearest valid date
        before/after the date.
    
        DateOffsets can be created to move dates forward a given number of
        valid dates.  For example, Bday(2) can be added to a date to move
        it two business days forward.  If the date does not start on a
        valid date, first it is moved to a valid date.  Thus pseudo code
        is::
    
            def __add__(date):
              date = rollback(date) # does nothing if date is valid
              return date + <n number of periods>
    
        When a date offset is created for a negative number of periods,
        the date is first rolled forward.  The pseudo code is::
    
            def __add__(date):
              date = rollforward(date) # does nothing if date is valid
              return date + <n number of periods>
    
        Zero presents a problem.  Should it roll forward or back?  We
        arbitrarily have it rollforward:
    
        date + BDay(0) == BDay.rollforward(date)
    
        Since 0 is a bit weird, we suggest avoiding its use.
    
        Besides, adding a DateOffsets specified by the singular form of the date
        component can be used to replace certain component of the timestamp.
    
        Attributes
        ----------
        n : int, default 1
            The number of time periods the offset represents.
            If specified without a temporal pattern, defaults to n days.
        normalize : bool, default False
            Whether to round the result of a DateOffset addition down to the
            previous midnight.
        weekday : int {0, 1, ..., 6}, default 0
    
            A specific integer for the day of the week.
    
            - 0 is Monday
            - 1 is Tuesday
            - 2 is Wednesday
            - 3 is Thursday
            - 4 is Friday
            - 5 is Saturday
            - 6 is Sunday
    
            Instead Weekday type from dateutil.relativedelta can be used.
    
            - MO is Monday
            - TU is Tuesday
            - WE is Wednesday
            - TH is Thursday
            - FR is Friday
            - SA is Saturday
            - SU is Sunday.
    
        **kwds
            Temporal parameter that add to or replace the offset value.
    
            Parameters that **add** to the offset (like Timedelta):
    
            - years
            - months
            - weeks
            - days
            - hours
            - minutes
            - seconds
            - milliseconds
            - microseconds
            - nanoseconds
    
            Parameters that **replace** the offset value:
    
            - year
            - month
            - day
            - weekday
            - hour
            - minute
            - second
            - microsecond
            - nanosecond.

        --------
        dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta : The relativedelta type is designed
            to be applied to an existing datetime and can replace specific components of
            that datetime, or represents an interval of time.
