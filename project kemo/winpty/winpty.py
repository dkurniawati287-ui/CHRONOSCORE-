class PTY(object):
    """
    Create a pseudo terminal (PTY) of a given size.
    
    The pseudo-terminal must define a non-zero, positive size for both columns and rows.
    
    Arguments
    ---------
    cols: int
        Number of columns (width) that the pseudo-terminal should have in characters.
    rows: int
        Number of rows (height) that the pseudo-terminal should have in characters.
    backend: Optional[int]
        Pseudo-terminal backend to use, see `winpty.Backend`. If None, then the backend
        will be set automatically based on the available APIs.
    mouse_mode: Optional[int]
        Set the mouse mode to one of the WINPTY_MOUSE_MODE_xxx constants.
        See `winpty.MouseMode`. Default: 0.
    timeout: Optional[int]
        Amount of time to wait for the agent (in ms) to startup and to wait for any given
        agent RPC request.  Must be greater than 0. Default: 30000.
    agent_config: Optional[int]
        A set of zero or more WINPTY_FLAG_xxx values. See `winpty.AgentConfig`.
        Default: WINPTY_FLAG_COLOR_ESCAPES
    
    Raises
    ------
    WinptyError:
        If an error occurred whilist creating the pseudo terminal instance.
    
    Notes
    -----
    1. Optional argument values will take effect if and only if the backend is set to
    `winpty.Backend.Winpty`, either automatically or manually.
    
    2. ConPTY backend will take precedence over WinPTY, as it is native to Windows
    and therefore is faster.
    
    3. Automatic backend selection will be determined based on both the compilation
    flags used to compile pywinpty and the availability of the APIs on the runtime
    system.

        blocking: bool
            If True, the call will be blocked until the requested length of string
